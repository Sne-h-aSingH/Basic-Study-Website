        <h1>What is Visual Basic?</h1>
        <div class="intro">
           <h2>Introduction</h2>
           <ul>
              <li><p>Visual Basic is a highly programming language.It has several features that allows the programmer to deveop applications for MS-Windows in an easy and efficient manner.</p></li>
              <li><p>Windows based application have a consistent useer interface, that helps the user to simply 'Point and Click'.</p></li>
              <li><p>Visual Basic has two parts.The "Visual" part refers to the method used to create the graphical user interface(GUI).The "basic" part refers to the BASIC language.</p></li>

    <div class="main">
        <h2>Visual Basic</h2>
        <p>Visual Basic is an Event Driven programming language for creating application for Microsoft Windows.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>VB has two components-:</p>
        <ol class="list">
            <li>An entensive collection pf prewritten tools, called <b>control</b> in the form of icons,Some example of controls are command buttons, text boxes,option buttons, checkbox etc.</li>
            <li>A complete set of program commands, drived from BASIC programming language.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It is one of the first programming language which incoporates"What You See is What You Get",environment</p>
        <p>Visual Basic is a tool that allows you to develop windows(GUI-Graphic User Interface)windows.</p>
        <p>An <b>event</b> refers to occurence of a user-action, such as when the user click the mouse or when presses a key on the keyboard etc.</p>
        <p>Visual Basic has features of Object Oreinted programming language.</p>
        <h2><b>Oject-related concept in VB-:</b></h2>
        <ol class="list">
            <li><b>Forms-:</b>
                In VB a window is called a form. All application in VB at least one form.You can place various controls on the form. 
                Each form contains a title bar as shownin figure-
                
            </li>
            <li><b>controls-:</b>
                The icons with which the user interact are called controls.
            </li>
            <li><b>Objects-:</b>
                Forms and controls are referred to collectively as objects.
            </li>
            <li><b>Properties-:</b>
                A property is a characteristics of an object such as its size,its caption or its colour etc.
            </li>
            <li><b>Methods-:</b>
            A method in VB is a predefined action that operates on a specific object(i.e. form or contorl.)For example, Set Focus method is to move the focus to the specified object.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="hardware">
        <h2><b>Hardware and Software requirement of Visual Basic</b></h2>
        <p>Hardware and Software requirement of VB are-:</p>
            <ol class="list">
            <li>Microsoft Windows 95 or later.</li>
            <li>486DX/66 MHz or higher processor</li>
            <li>A Mouse</li>
            <li>A CD-ROM drive or DVD drive</li>
            <li>Minimum 16 MB of RAM for windows 95, but 32 MB of RAM is desirable.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><b>Setting up Visual Basic</b></h2>
        <p>To set up VB from CD,the following steps are used:</p>
        <ol class="list">
            <li>Insert the CD in the CD-ROM drive</li>

            <li>Follow the setup instruction on the screen.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><b>Features of Visual Basic</b></h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Easy to learn and use.</p></li>
            <li><p>Built in capabiltity to create user interface.</p></li>
